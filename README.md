# Entwined

Entwined software repository picks up where '2squared's Entwined branch leaves off, and its first use is supporting the Entwined 2020 (Entwined Meadows) installation in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

More information will be added as the project comes into being.

# OLDLX

This directory uses a version of LX studio from many years ago - but it works, and has all the functional
tree mappings. Work can continue here as we integrate the new LX studio.

# LXStudio-IDE

This directory is the new LX Studio. It is a staging place to see if we can get the new LX Studio working.
